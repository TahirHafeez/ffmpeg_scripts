# blend videos old https://youtu.be/yrUGUrYfccY new https://youtu.be/2CT7h9i2Eqk
# the videos go through all 33 options for you to see the output. For the examples below I've just used the addition option

# These videos use the blend command and you can see what the effect looks like, the new video
# I made thanks to the help of a comment I got from Astroni800 to get better results

# OLD video commands
# command example:
ffmpeg -i video.MOV -i imager.png -filter_complex blend=all_mode=addition addition.MOV

# this command runs but for better results you need the same gbrp color formats (see comment below)
# you can also use 2 videos as the inputs. 

# If you do tblend the t stands for time, and when I tried it, it only worked for 1 video as the input 
# and I only had 1 input. Here is an example of a tblend command:
ffmpeg -i output.MOV -filter_complex tblend=vividlight vivid.MOV

# NEW video commands
# Thanks Astroni800

# heres the comment he gave:
# Try to convert both streams to gbrp color format, like:

ffmpeg -i video.MOV -i imager.png -filter_complex "[0:v]format=gbrp[f0],[1:v]format=gbrp[f1],[f0][f1]blend=all_mode=addition" addition.MOV
