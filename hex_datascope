# here's a youtube example of the command https://youtu.be/aUg5u6PefRs

ffmpeg -i original.MOV -vf "format=yuv444p,datascope=mode=color2" outputdatascope.MOV

# this is a filter, not sure what its useful for. I changed the mode to color2, 
# you could also try mode=color but the color isn't as bright. 
# Saw this done by a couple other youtubers: https://youtu.be/tyYNY5gYY2o  https://youtu.be/iBVlcq7KoKg

# the documentation for it is here: https://ffmpeg.org/ffmpeg-filters.html#datascope
