#MAKING ROLLING CREDITS example on youtube https://youtu.be/AnsaJLUIPjs

#I wanted to see if I could make some rolling credits for the end of my video's I found this example:

ffmpeg -i input.mkv -vf "drawtext=textfile=credits.txt: x=200: y=h-80*t: fontsize=36:fontcolor=white@0.9: box=1: boxcolor=black@0.6" -c:a copy outputCredits.mkv

#(input.mkv - is the name of the video I'm using)
#(credits.txt - a text file that I want to roll through)
#(outputCredits.mkv - is the created file)
