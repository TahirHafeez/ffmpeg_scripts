# here's the command for a horizontal scroll. if you want vertical scroll replace the h with a v.

ffmpeg -i input.mp4  -vf "scroll=h=0.001,crop=640:360:0:ih" outputscroll.mp4

# this is the command for scrolling through a photo: 

ffmpeg -loop 1 -framerate 30 -i input.JPG -vf "scroll=0.001,crop=640:360:0:ih,format=yuv420p" -preset veryslow -crf 18 -t 10 output.mp4

# I got the command above from the link https://twitter.com/FFmpeg/status/1180179571456372737

# note: when I tried to make an .MOV file it didn't seem to work.
