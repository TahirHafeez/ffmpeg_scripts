# fading 2 videos into each other - youtube example https://youtu.be/hJH2tJTK8Kc
# I got this from this link: https://ffmpeg.org/ffmpeg-filters.html#Examples-121

# fading 2 videos together:
ffmpeg -i 1.MOV -i 2.MOV -filter_complex xfade=transition=fade:duration=2:offset=5 output.MOV

# video wipes up:
ffmpeg -i 1.MOV -i 2.MOV -filter_complex xfade=transition=wipeup:duration=2:offset=3 output.MOV

# video transitions from the center:
ffmpeg -i 1.MOV -i 2.MOV -filter_complex xfade=transition=circleclose:duration=2:offset=3 output.MOV

# this command crashed when I first ran it, I cut the video up into 10 second chunks and it worked fine.
# my other video on how to do that https://youtu.be/sAl1lZMVr5A
# when I tried to concatenate the videos as I have done previously it came up with an error: Non-monotonous DTS in output stream 0:0
# After a few different attempts I decided to use the overlay command which I have shown an example at 2:00
# And heres a link to the documentaion on overlay: https://ffmpeg.org/ffmpeg-all.html#Commands-58
# link to xfade: https://ffmpeg.org/ffmpeg-all.html#Examples-159
