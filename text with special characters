# escape characters are the characters that you need to use to get the special characters to "show up", 
# Basically, most of the time you can just put an extra backslash in front of the character 
# if you are typing in the text in the command to add a backslash I had to type 10 backslashes
# the output text for the command below is \%@!$:#

ffmpeg -i input.mp4 -vf "drawtext=text='\\\\\\\\\\\%\@\!\$\:\#':fontsize=100:fontcolor=white:borderw=7:y=400:x=100" output.mp4

# or you could use a textfile instead and if you do that you only have to use 1 backslash to escape the backslash

echo '\\\%\@\!\$\:\#' > text.txt
ffmpeg -i input.mp4 -vf "drawtext=textfile=text.txt:fontsize=100:fontcolor=white:borderw=7:y=400:x=100" output.mp4

# these are 2 different methods to do the same thing.
