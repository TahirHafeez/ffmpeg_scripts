# Reversing a video and multiple videos - youtube example https://youtu.be/3PfCwbNXAV0

# Warning: This filter requires memory to buffer the entire clip, so trimming is suggested

# I have a video on how to break a video up into smaller chunks
# https://youtu.be/sAl1lZMVr5A​

# Firstly the ffmpeg command to reverse a single file is 0:34​ :
ffmpeg -i input.MOV -vf reverse reversed_output.MOV

# -i input.MOV is the video that I want to reverse
# -vf reverse creates the filtergraph specified by reverse and use it to filter the stream
# reversed_output.MOV is the video that has been reversed

# I have a bunch of videos numbered consecutively file 
# input_000.MOV, input_001.MOV etc... up to input_012.MOV 
# that I want to reverse. So I make a script 2:41​ :

#! /bin/sh
                                                                           
for i in{000..012}                                                   
do
        ffmpeg -i input_$i.MOV -vf reverse output_$i.MOV
done
