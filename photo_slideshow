# adding still images together in a slideshow video my example video https://youtu.be/8x3Nldwx7Hk

cat *.JPG | ffmpeg -framerate 3 -f image2pipe -i - output.MOV


# found this helpful website with examples https://trac.ffmpeg.org/wiki/Slideshow
# cat * .JPG = this command collected all the files I had in the folder that ended with .JPG, 
# so if your files end with a different suffix use that.
# then it was piped thru to ffmpeg.
# the framerate  of 3, I believe stands for 3 frames per second
# image2pipe option is for handling all the images collected.
# make sure that you  put a space between "-" and "output.MOV" because the "-" is supposed to be sitting by itself. 
# it's referring to the input for the video is from the images that have been piped in.
# I have made an output.MOV because my other files are .MOV but you can choose what you want.
