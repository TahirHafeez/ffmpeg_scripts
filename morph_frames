#heres a helpful question and answer I found:
#https://stackoverflow.com/questions/71178068/video-morph-between-two-images-ffmpeg-minterpolate

#the commands I used. (I used low fps because my computer #crashed when I used 24 fps, try with the lower fps first, #if you have a good computer you can go higher)

#first I wanted to combine a number of images into a single video:
cat *.png | ffmpeg -framerate .5 -f image2pipe -i - input.mp4

#I use the video I just created called input.mp4 for the minterpotaltion command:
ffmpeg -i input.mp4 -vf minterpolate=fps=6 output.mp4

#this command below is for a blend effect:
ffmpeg -i input.mp4 -vf minterpolate=fps=4:mi_mode=blend blend-minterpolate.mp4

#have a nice day.
